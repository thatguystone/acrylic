# Acrylic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thatguystone/acrylic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thatguystone/acrylic)

Acrylic is the static site generator used for stoney.io. I haven't really put together docs or anything on it, but here are a few features:

* Full asset pipeline (SCSS to CSS, concated+minified JS, minifed HTML, etc)
* Image resizing
* Automatic rebuilds
* Pongo2 (django-style) templates for pages
* Date-ordered posts
